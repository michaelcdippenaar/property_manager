# Klikk — Tremly Property Manager: Project Context

## Overview
Full-stack property management platform for **Klikk (Pty) Ltd** (Tremly). Manages residential rental properties in South Africa. Monorepo with multiple apps:

| App | Stack | URL |
|-----|-------|-----|
| `backend/` | Django 5 + DRF + PostgreSQL + Channels | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `admin/` | Vue 3 + Pinia + TypeScript (multi-role SPA) | `http://localhost:5173` |
| `web_app/` | Vue 3 + TypeScript (tenant portal) | `http://localhost:5174` |
| `tenant_app/` | Flutter (Dart) | iOS/Android |

---

## Running Locally

```bash
# PostgreSQL (Docker or Homebrew)
docker compose up db          # or: brew services start postgresql@15

# Note: docker compose (as in this repo) runs db, backend, and admin only — not web_app.
# Start the tenant web app separately (see below).

# Backend
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver

# Admin SPA (serves agent, supplier, owner portals)
cd admin
npm run dev

# Tenant web app
cd web_app
npm run dev

# Flutter (once SDK installed)
cd tenant_app
flutter run
```

## Supplier Matching Algorithm

`backend/apps/maintenance/matching.py` — `rank_suppliers(maintenance_request)`

Scores suppliers (0-100) based on weighted factors:
1. **Proximity** (30%) — haversine distance, excluded if outside service_radius_km
2. **Skills match** (25%) — trade alignment with request
3. **Price history** (15%) — average quote vs global average
4. **Owner preference** (20%) — preferred/linked via SupplierProperty
5. **Rating** (10%) — supplier.rating

Returns top N suppliers sorted by score with per-factor breakdown.

---

## Notification Service

`backend/apps/maintenance/notifications.py` — Currently logs to console.

Ready for SMS/WhatsApp integration (Twilio). When a dispatch is sent, each supplier gets a notification with a tokenised link to view and quote on the job.

## Key Business Rules
- Up to 4 tenants per property unit
- Each tenant can have a guardian/co-debtor
- Water included up to 4,000 litres/month per occupant
- Electricity via prepaid meter (tenant pays directly)
- Deposit = 1 month rent (standard)
- Early termination: 20 business days notice, up to 3 months penalty
- Payment references per tenant: `"<Property> - <Surname>"`
- Landlord: Klikk (Pty) Ltd, reg 2016/113758/07

### Lease status & unit occupancy

`Lease.status` is one of: `pending`, `active`, `expired`, `terminated`. Definitions:

| Status | Meaning | Occupies the unit? |
|--------|---------|--------------------|
| `pending` | Future lease — has not started yet **or** is issued but unsigned (waiting for signature) | **No** |
| `active` | Signed and currently in-progress (tenant in possession) | **Yes** |
| `expired` | End date has passed | No |
| `terminated` | Cancelled before end date | No |

**Only `active` leases set `Unit.status = 'occupied'`.** Pending/unsigned leases never block a unit — you can issue a new lease while another is still being signed without the unit going "occupied".

**Authoritative implementation:** `backend/apps/leases/signals.py::_resync_unit_status`. The signal fires on **both** `post_save` and `post_delete` of `Lease`, so deleting the only active lease releases the unit. If you add code that filters leases for occupancy/availability, use `status='active'` only — never `status__in=['active','pending']`. The two `active_lease_info` serializer methods in `apps/properties/serializers.py` follow the same rule.

Regression tests: `backend/apps/test_hub/leases/unit/test_signals.py::SyncUnitStatusTests`.
