## Goal
Bump `@quasar/app-vite` from v1 to v2.6 and all `@capacitor/*` packages from v6 to v8 to eliminate six high-severity npm advisories (including CVSS 8.1 RCE in `serialize-javascript`) from the mobile app build pipeline.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] `@quasar/app-vite` bumped to `^2.6.0` (or latest v2 stable) with quasar build verified clean
- [x] `@capacitor/cli` bumped to `^8.3.1` with all `@capacitor/*` packages aligned to v8
- [x] `npm audit --audit-level=high` exits 0 inside `agent-app/`
- [ ] iOS + Android Capacitor build confirmed working after upgrade
- [x] CI `security.yml` agent-app job tightened back to `--audit-level=high`

## Files likely touched
- `agent-app/package.json`
- `agent-app/package-lock.json`
- `agent-app/src/` (any breaking API changes from major version bumps)
- `agent-app/capacitor.config.ts` (if plugin config changes required)
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`

## Test plan
**Manual:**
- `cd agent-app && npm audit --audit-level=high` — confirm 0 high findings
- `npm run build` — confirm Quasar build succeeds
- `npx cap sync ios && npx cap sync android` — confirm Capacitor plugins sync
- Smoke-test iOS and Android simulator builds

**Automated:**
- CI security workflow passes with `--audit-level=high`

## Handoff notes
2026-04-23: Promoted from discovery `2026-04-23-agent-app-quasar-capacitor-major-upgrade.md` (found during RNT-SEC-010). `serialize-javascript` carries GHSA-5c6j-r48x-rmvq CVSS 8.1 RCE; build-time only but supply-chain risk. All six highs require major version bumps. See `docs/ops/dependency-audit-2026-04.md`.

2026-04-23 (implementer): Upgrades applied. Summary of changes:

**package.json:**
- `@quasar/app-vite`: `^1.9.0` → `^2.6.0`
- `@capacitor/cli`: `^6.0.0` → `^8.3.1`
- `@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/ios`, `@capacitor/android`: `^6.0.0` → `^8.3.1`
- `@capacitor/splash-screen`: `^6.0.0` → `^8.0.1`
- `@capacitor/status-bar`: `^6.0.0` → `^8.0.2`
- `@quasar/extras`: `^1.16.0` → `^1.17.0` (peer dep requirement for v2)
- `@sentry/capacitor`: `^1.0.0` → `^3.2.1` (in-scope sub-fix: v1 was hard-incompatible with v8 Capacitor; v3 requires `@sentry/vue` pinned to exact version)
- `@sentry/vue`: `^8.0.0` → `10.43.0` (exact pin required by `@sentry/capacitor@^3`)
- `--legacy-peer-deps` flag removed from CI install (no longer needed)

**quasar.config.js:** Converted from CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`) to ESM (`import`/`export default`) since `@quasar/app-vite` v2 treats `.js` config as ESM format.

**tsconfig.json:** Dropped `extends: "@quasar/app-vite/tsconfig-preset"` — that path was removed in v2 (no longer exported). Inlined the equivalent compiler options (`module: Preserve`, `strict: true`, `lib: [es2022, dom]`) plus explicit `include` for `.d.ts`, `.ts`, `.vue` files. The old preset's options were minimal and identical.

**`.github/workflows/security.yml`:** Removed `--legacy-peer-deps` from install and reverted `--audit-level=critical` back to `--audit-level=high` as planned.

**Audit result:** `npm audit --audit-level=high` → 0 vulnerabilities (was 6 highs + 3 moderates).

**Smoke-check:** `quasar build` (SPA mode) succeeds cleanly — 574 KB JS, 254 KB CSS, Build succeeded. iOS/Android Capacitor sync (`npx cap sync`) and simulator smoke-test are left to the tester — requires Xcode and Android Studio.

2026-04-23 (reviewer): **Review passed.** Verified against acceptance criteria:

- `@quasar/app-vite ^2.6.0`, `@capacitor/* ^8.3.1`, `@sentry/capacitor ^3.2.1`, `@sentry/vue 10.43.0` (exact pin) all present in `agent-app/package.json` as claimed.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` re-run in `agent-app/` → **found 0 vulnerabilities**. Claim holds.
- Lockfile sanity: 674 `resolved` entries each paired with `integrity` hash; no empty integrities, no `file:`/`link:`/`git+` resolutions. No `--force` artefacts visible.
- `quasar.config.js` ESM shape verified via `node --input-type=module -e "import('./quasar.config.js')"`: `default` is a function and returned config exposes the expected keys (`boot`, `css`, `extras`, `framework`, `build`, `devServer`, `capacitor`, `animations`, `pwa`, `ssr`, `electron`). Env injection still fires.
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`: `--legacy-peer-deps` removed, `--audit-level=high` restored. No other workflow changes.
- No FE behaviour changes smuggled in — diff touches only `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `quasar.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `security.yml`. `src/boot/errorLogger.ts` (Sentry init) untouched; API surface for `@sentry/capacitor` v3 matches the existing call shape (positional `SentryVue.init` second arg is still the documented v3 pattern).
- iOS/Android simulator verification correctly deferred to tester (needs Xcode + Android Studio).

Nit-level findings, filed as discovery `2026-04-23-quasar-config-esm-nits.md` (not blocking this task): unused `fileURLToPath` import and missing `"type": "module"` in `agent-app/package.json` (Node prints `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` on every load).

Process note for PM: implementer's changes were committed inside `f4e5e163` ("RNT-022: review → in-progress") instead of a dedicated `RNT-SEC-037: implement → review` commit — the task file was moved into `review/` in the same commit. Diff was cleanly isolatable via `git show f4e5e163 -- agent-app/package.json agent-app/quasar.config.js agent-app/tsconfig.json .github/workflows/security.yml`, but worth flagging so future audits aren't confused.

2026-04-23 (tester): **BLOCKED — `cap sync ios` fails: iOS deployment target not updated.**

### Test run

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | PASS — found 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm run build` (Quasar SPA) | PASS — 574 KB JS, 254 KB CSS, Build succeeded |
| `npx cap sync ios` | FAIL — pod install error (see below) |
| `npx cap sync android` | FAIL — android platform not added to project |
| Simulator smoke-test (iOS) | NOT RUN — blocked by cap sync failure |
| Simulator smoke-test (Android) | NOT RUN — android platform missing |

**`cap sync ios` failure (verbatim):**

✖ Updating iOS native dependencies with pod install - failed!
✖ update ios - failed!
[error] Analyzing dependencies
        [!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "CapacitorApp":
        In Podfile:
          CapacitorApp (from `../../node_modules/@capacitor/app`)

        Specs satisfying the `CapacitorApp (from `../../node_modules/@capacitor/app`)` dependency were
        found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
```

**Root cause:** All Capacitor v8 pods (`@capacitor/app`, `@capacitor/ios`, `@capacitor/splash-screen`, `@capacitor/status-bar`) declare `s.ios.deployment_target = '15.0'` in their podspecs. The project's `agent-app/ios/App/Podfile` still declares `platform :ios, '13.0'`. The implementer bumped the npm packages but did not update the iOS native project's deployment target.

**Fix required:** In `agent-app/ios/App/Podfile`, change `platform :ios, '13.0'` to `platform :ios, '15.0'`. Also need to verify `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in the Xcode project settings (`ios/App/App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`) is also raised to 15.0, or `assertDeploymentTarget` in the post_install hook will reject it.

**Android:** `android/` directory is absent from the repo (`cap sync android` errors with "android platform has not been added yet"). This is a pre-existing condition unrelated to this upgrade — Android was likely never set up. Not blocking for this task but the iOS fix is required.
