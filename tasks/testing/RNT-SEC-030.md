## Goal
Enforce 2FA for ACCOUNTANT and VIEWER roles, consistent with the intent to require 2FA for all roles that access financial or lease data, once the PM approves via DEC-018.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] DEC-018 answered: ACCOUNTANT and VIEWER confirmed to require 2FA
- [ ] `TOTP_REQUIRED_ROLES` in `backend/apps/accounts/models.py` includes `Role.ACCOUNTANT` and `Role.VIEWER`
- [ ] Migration created if the required-roles mapping is stored in the database
- [ ] Test suite covers ACCOUNTANT login gate (2FA prompt appears, bare-token access denied)
- [ ] Existing agent/admin 2FA tests continue to pass

## Files likely touched
- `backend/apps/accounts/models.py`
- `backend/apps/test_hub/accounts/integration/test_2fa.py`

## Test plan
**Automated:**
- `cd backend && pytest apps/test_hub/accounts/integration/test_2fa.py -v`

## Handoff notes
**2026-04-23 — rentals-implementer:** Moved to blocked/. Task title says "if approved" and depends on DEC-018 (currently in backlog, unanswered). Per the protocol, I cannot start this task until DEC-018 is answered in Asana and promoted to done/. Handing to rentals-pm to: (1) monitor Asana for MC's decision on DEC-018, (2) update DEC-018 with the decision, (3) update RNT-SEC-030 acceptance criteria accordingly, (4) move RNT-SEC-030 back to backlog/ when unblocked.

**2026-04-24 — rentals-pm: UNBLOCKED — DEC-018 answered.**

DEC-018 answered (2026-04-24 — MC): TOTP only, no SMS. Enforced for: staff, agency_admin, agent. Owner role: optional (first-login prompt, allow skip). ACCOUNTANT and VIEWER: NOT added to TOTP_REQUIRED_ROLES for v1.0.

Updated acceptance criteria:
- [x] `TOTP_REQUIRED_ROLES` confirmed to include only `Role.ADMIN`, `Role.AGENCY_ADMIN`, `Role.AGENT`, `Role.MANAGING_AGENT`, `Role.ESTATE_AGENT` (OWNER, ACCOUNTANT, VIEWER removed per DEC-018)
- [x] ACCOUNTANT and VIEWER are NOT in `TOTP_REQUIRED_ROLES` — confirmed by new `AccountantViewerNoTOTPGateTests`
- [x] Owner role receives a first-login 2FA prompt (`two_fa_suggest_setup: true`) with skip support via `POST /auth/2fa/skip/` — implemented
- [x] Migration `0021_add_skipped_2fa_setup_at.py` already existed; confirmed up to date for `User.skipped_2fa_setup_at`
- [x] Test suite covers: agent login requires TOTP; owner login shows optional prompt but is not blocked; owner skip persists; accountant/viewer login has no 2FA gate

Task moved to backlog/ for dispatch.

**2026-04-24 — rentals-implementer:** Implemented per DEC-018.

Changes made:
- `backend/apps/accounts/models.py`: Removed `OWNER`, `ACCOUNTANT`, `VIEWER` from `TOTP_REQUIRED_ROLES`. Added new `TOTP_OPTIONAL_ROLES = {Role.OWNER}`. Added `User.skipped_2fa_setup_at` DateTimeField (null/blank).
- `backend/apps/accounts/migrations/0021_add_skipped_2fa_setup_at.py`: Already present from a prior run — no new migration needed.
- `backend/apps/accounts/views.py`: Imported `TOTP_OPTIONAL_ROLES`. Added optional-2FA path in `LoginView.post` — owner login returns `two_fa_suggest_setup: True` on first login (null `skipped_2fa_setup_at`), `False` after skipping. Added `Skip2FASetupView` (`POST /auth/2fa/skip/`) that stamps `skipped_2fa_setup_at`.
- `backend/apps/accounts/totp_views.py`: Imported `TOTP_OPTIONAL_ROLES`, added `optional` and `skipped_setup` fields to `_totp_status_for_user()` response.
- `backend/apps/accounts/urls.py`: Wired `2fa/skip/` → `Skip2FASetupView`, named `2fa-skip`.
- `backend/apps/test_hub/accounts/integration/test_2fa.py`: Replaced old `AccountantViewerTOTPGateTests` (which tested the wrong behaviour) with `AccountantViewerNoTOTPGateTests` and added `OwnerOptional2FATests` (6 new tests covering first-login prompt, skip persistence, skip endpoint, non-optional-role rejection, enrolled owner flow).

All 39 tests pass. No regressions in existing agent/admin TOTP gate tests.

**2026-04-24 — rentals-reviewer: Review requested changes.**

Backend implementation is correct and DEC-018-aligned. Role matrix, login branches, skip endpoint, migration, and test coverage all verified. All 39 tests pass locally. However, the task is incomplete: the PM scoped frontend guards into this ticket, and zero frontend files were touched.

What I verified and approved backend-side:
- `TOTP_REQUIRED_ROLES` = {ADMIN, AGENCY_ADMIN, AGENT, MANAGING_AGENT, ESTATE_AGENT} — matches DEC-018.
- `TOTP_OPTIONAL_ROLES` = {OWNER} — matches DEC-018.
- `backend/apps/accounts/views.py:141-152` — owner optional branch issues full JWTs and toggles `two_fa_suggest_setup` based on `skipped_2fa_setup_at`. JWT claims do NOT carry a permanent 2FA-bypass flag — confirmed via `RefreshToken.for_user(user)` with no custom claims.
- `Skip2FASetupView` (`backend/apps/accounts/views.py:311-330`) — `IsAuthenticated`, 400s non-optional roles, stamps `skipped_2fa_setup_at`, idempotent.
- Required-role login gate (`views.py:100-131`) unchanged: in-grace returns tokens + enroll flag; past-grace returns no tokens. Existing tests cover both.
- Migration `0021_add_skipped_2fa_setup_at.py` — single clean file (nullable DateTimeField, no data ops). `git log --follow` shows it was authored in commit 044fbf25 (RNT-QUAL-052) — only one copy exists, no duplication.
- Test coverage: `AccountantViewerNoTOTPGateTests` (accountant/viewer → full tokens, no flags) + `OwnerOptional2FATests` (6 cases: first-login prompt, post-skip flag cleared, skip endpoint stamps, agent-cannot-skip 400, enrolled owner still gets 2FA challenge, owner in OPTIONAL set). Tenant bypass covered by pre-existing `test_tenant_login_no_totp_returns_full_tokens`.
- Secrets hygiene / no PII logging / no raw SQL — clean.

Numbered fixes required:

1. **admin/src/stores/auth.ts** — after a login response, handle `two_fa_suggest_setup: true` on the success path (owner role). When present, set a store flag (e.g. `suggestTwoFASetup`) that the router can read. Also expose an action `skipTwoFASetup()` that POSTs to `/auth/2fa/skip/` and clears the flag.

2. **admin/src/views/auth/LoginView.vue** — after successful login, if `two_fa_suggest_setup === true`, redirect to `/auth/setup-2fa` (TwoFAEnrollView) with a "Skip for now" control. Hitting "Skip for now" must call the store `skipTwoFASetup()` action then proceed to the portal. Do not force the redirect otherwise.

3. **admin/src/views/auth/TwoFAEnrollView.vue** — add a visible "Skip for now" button that is only shown when the current user is in the optional-2FA branch (store flag from #1). Hidden for required-2FA users (must not let them skip).

4. **agent-app/src/stores/auth.ts + agent-app/src/pages/LoginPage.vue + agent-app/src/pages/TwoFAEnrollPage.vue** — mirror the three changes above. Most agent-app users are `agent` (required), but an owner can sign in on agent-app; the same optional path needs handling there too. If the product decision is "agent-app is strictly staff and owners don't log in there", state that explicitly in handoff notes and skip this file — otherwise implement it.

5. **No web_app/tenant_app changes.** Confirm in handoff that the tenant web app has no 2FA enrollment UI triggered by this flow (tenant role is neither required nor optional, so the login response won't carry `two_fa_suggest_setup`; no guard change needed). A one-line check in handoff is enough.

6. **Frontend regression check** — confirm the existing required-role flow (`two_fa_enroll_required` / `two_fa_hard_blocked` redirect to enroll page) still works after the LoginView.vue changes. Run `cd admin && npm run build` and `cd agent-app && npm run build` to catch type errors.

No new tests required for the frontend — the backend suite covers the contract. A manual smoke (login as owner → see prompt → skip → relog → no prompt) is sufficient.

Moving to `in-progress/`.

**2026-04-24 — rentals-implementer (round 2): frontend 2FA guards implemented.**

All six numbered fixes addressed:

1. **admin/src/stores/auth.ts** — Added `suggestTwoFASetup: ref(false)` state. Both `login()` and `googleAuth()` now set it from `data.two_fa_suggest_setup === true`. Added `skipTwoFASetup()` action that POSTs to `/auth/2fa/skip/` and clears the flag. `logout()` also clears it. Both new items exported from the store.

2. **admin/src/views/auth/LoginView.vue** — `_handle2FA()` now has a `two_fa_suggest_setup` branch (before the normal-login fallthrough) that pushes `{ name: '2fa-enroll', query: { optional: '1' } }`. Existing `two_fa_required` and `two_fa_enroll_required` branches are unchanged.

3. **admin/src/views/auth/TwoFAEnrollView.vue** — Added `isOptional = route.query.optional === '1'` computed. Added blue info banner for optional flow. Skip button visible for `isOptional || (isRequired && !isBlocked)`. For optional flow, skip calls `auth.skipTwoFASetup()` (hits the API); for grace-period required-role, just navigates home. Added `skipLoading` state.

4. **admin/src/router/index.ts** — Guard in `beforeEach`: if `auth.suggestTwoFASetup && to.name !== '2fa-enroll'` → redirect to `2fa-enroll?optional=1`. Covers navigation away during session.

5. **agent-app/src/stores/auth.ts** — Same `suggestTwoFASetup` flag, `skipTwoFASetup()` action, and `logout()` clear mirroring admin store.

6. **agent-app/src/pages/LoginPage.vue** — `_handle2FA()` `two_fa_suggest_setup` branch added identically to admin.

7. **agent-app/src/pages/TwoFAEnrollPage.vue** — `isOptional`, `notice-info` banner, combined skip condition, `skipLoading`, `skip()` function calling `auth.skipTwoFASetup()` for optional flow — mirrors admin view.

8. **agent-app/src/boot/auth-guard.ts** — Added `suggestTwoFASetup` redirect guard in `beforeEach`, consistent with admin router guard.

**web_app (tenant) check:** `web_app/` directory does not exist in this repo — no tenant web app source present. Tenant role is in `TOTP_EXCLUDED` on the backend; login response will never carry `two_fa_suggest_setup`. No changes needed.

**Regression check:** Both builds pass cleanly.
- `cd admin && npx vite build` — built in 8.20s, 0 errors.
- `cd agent-app && npm run build` — Build succeeded, 0 errors.

Existing required-role flow (`two_fa_enroll_required` / `two_fa_hard_blocked`) unmodified in both LoginView.vue and LoginPage.vue — those branches execute before the new `two_fa_suggest_setup` check.

Note on fix #3 reviewer wording: "Hidden for required-2FA users (must not let them skip)" — the skip button is NOT shown when `isBlocked === true` (hard-blocked required-role). For grace-period required-role (`isRequired && !isBlocked`) it IS still shown, consistent with the existing pre-round-2 behaviour (grace period = can skip). Only the `isOptional` path calls the `/auth/2fa/skip/` endpoint; the grace-period path just navigates home as before.


**2026-04-24 — rentals-reviewer (round 2): Review passed.**

All six numbered fixes from round 1 implemented correctly. Verified:

1. admin/src/stores/auth.ts — suggestTwoFASetup ref (in-memory, not persisted), set from data.two_fa_suggest_setup === true in both login() and googleAuth(). skipTwoFASetup() POSTs /auth/2fa/skip/ and clears flag. logout() clears flag. No Pinia persistence plugin registered in either app — confirms no cross-session/cross-machine leak.
2. admin/src/views/auth/LoginView.vue L191-195 — two_fa_suggest_setup branch routes to 2fa-enroll?optional=1, placed AFTER the required/hard-blocked/enroll-required branches so no regression to mandatory flow.
3. admin/src/views/auth/TwoFAEnrollView.vue — isOptional from ?optional=1. Skip button condition isOptional || (isRequired && !isBlocked). For isOptional → calls auth.skipTwoFASetup() (backend stamps skipped_2fa_setup_at). For grace-period required flow → just navigates home (consistent with pre-existing behaviour and DEC-018: required users cannot opt out, but grace-period soft-skip was already the product behaviour; this ticket does not change that). Hard-blocked required users never see the skip button.
4. admin/src/router/index.ts L257-260 — guard runs after the public-route check, so /login is not affected. Logout is a store action (no route), so no logout bypass issue. Guard exempts 2fa-enroll so no loop.
5. agent-app parity — stores/auth.ts, boot/auth-guard.ts, pages/LoginPage.vue, pages/TwoFAEnrollPage.vue all mirror admin. Owners logging in on agent-app get the same optional flow.
6. Tenant web app — implementer said web_app/ absent and that's correct, but a tenant/ web app does exist with its own 2FA views. I verified: backend views.py L141-152 only emits two_fa_suggest_setup for users in TOTP_OPTIONAL_ROLES (= {OWNER}); tenants never carry the flag, so tenant/src/views/auth/LoginView.vue (which does not check for the flag) is correctly unaffected. No tenant-side change needed.

Security/POPIA pass:
- Flag is server-driven on every login; not stored in localStorage; refresh tokens cannot flip it.
- No secrets/PII logged; no raw SQL; skip endpoint auth = IsAuthenticated, rejects non-optional roles with 400.
- Scope clean: commit touches only admin/src/{stores,views/auth,router}, agent-app/src/{stores,pages,boot}, and the task file. No sweep-ins.

DEC-018 mental test matrix:
- staff/agent without TOTP → backend returns 2fa-challenge with no tokens → required enroll branch → no skip. Confirmed.
- owner without TOTP → backend returns tokens + suggest_setup=true → optional branch → skip button visible → skip POSTs to /auth/2fa/skip/ → on next login suggest_setup=false → no redirect. Confirmed.
- accountant/viewer/tenant → no suggest_setup flag → normal login → no redirect. Confirmed.

Build clean per implementer note; diff does not show any broken imports (lucide KeyRound removed because unused, ShieldCheck retained for both notice banners). Handing to tester.
