## Goal
Verify every push notification deep-link route actually exists in the agent-app and tenant app routers; add missing routes or update screen-name mappings so tapping any notification lands the user on the correct screen.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Audit `agent-app/src/router/index.ts` against all `SCREEN_ROUTES` entries in `agent-app/src/services/push.ts`; add missing routes or correct screen names
- [x] Audit `tenant/src/router/index.ts` against all `urlMap` entries in `tenant/public/sw.js`; add missing routes or correct paths
- [ ] Manual smoke-test on real device (iOS or Android): tap each push notification type; confirm correct screen opens
- [ ] No silent navigation failures in the app console

## Files likely touched
- `agent-app/src/services/push.ts` (`SCREEN_ROUTES` mapping, lines ~18–22)
- `agent-app/src/router/index.ts`
- `tenant/public/sw.js` (`urlMap` in `notificationclick` handler)
- `tenant/src/router/index.ts`

## Test plan
**Manual:**
- Trigger each push type (lease, mandate, rent, maintenance, chat) from admin/backend
- Tap notification on physical device; verify correct detail screen opens

**Automated:**
- Unit test: mock router.push and verify each `SCREEN_ROUTES` key resolves to a defined route

## Handoff notes
(Each agent appends a dated entry here on handoff. Do not edit prior entries.)

2026-04-24 — Promoted from discovery `2026-04-23-push-deep-link-route-completion.md`. Routes added during RNT-QUAL-007 may reference paths that don't yet exist in the router.

2026-04-24 — implementer: Audited all four files. Fixes applied:

**agent-app/src/services/push.ts** — All four SCREEN_ROUTES were broken:
- `lease_detail` pointed to `/leases/:id` (no detail page exists); corrected to `/leases` list.
- `mandate_detail` pointed to `/mandates/:id` (no mandates route exists); corrected to `/pipeline`.
- `maintenance_detail` pointed to `/maintenance/:id` (no detail route); corrected to `/maintenance` list.
- `invoice_detail` pointed to `/payments/invoices/:id` (no payments route); corrected to `/today`.

**tenant/public/sw.js** — All three urlMap entries were broken:
- `tenant_lease_detail` → was `/lease`; corrected to `/home/lease` (nested under AppShell).
- `tenant_maintenance_detail` → was `/maintenance/:id`; corrected to `/issues/:id` (issues = maintenance in tenant).
- `tenant_invoice_detail` → was `/payments/:id` (no route); corrected to `/home/dashboard` as fallback.

Caveats for reviewer: where no detail page exists the fallback is the closest list/dashboard. As detail pages are added in future tasks, these mappings should be tightened to pass the entity ID. Manual device smoke-test (AC-3/4) is left for the tester.
